## Code for recommender systems (RS) experiments

Our code is adapted from [ReChorus](https://github.com/THUIR/ReChorus), which is a general PyTorch framework for Top-K recommendation. The data we used in the experiments can be downloaded from [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1hZ1T24hFCUmkHRLTdR4GxX9BoD3LFNBm?usp=sharing).
