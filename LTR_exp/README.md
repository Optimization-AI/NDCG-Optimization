## Code for Learning to Rank (LTR) experiments

For these experiments, we use two large-scale LTR datasets, [MSLR-WEB30K](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/mslr/) and [Yahoo! LTR dataset](https://webscope.sandbox.yahoo.com). We adopt [allRank](https://github.com/allegro/allRank) as our code base.
